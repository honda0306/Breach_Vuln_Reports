### Summary

Many Android users have been targeted once again through malware masquerading as different apps. The malware has been named ANDROIDOS_MOBSTSPY, and 5 of the 6 had been removed from the Google Play store last February. The last one has just been removed in the last few days. The malware ran phishing attacks against Android users, and usually posed as Google and Facebook ads that would trick users into delivering their credentials.

# tl;dr
> Several Android apps were removed that tried to phish user credentials by pretending to be Google apps or Facebook.
