### Summary

Last November, Marriott International announced a multi-million record breach. The number of affected accounts was significant, but apparently not quite as many records were affected than initially thought. According to the Dark Reading Staff:

> Marriott International now says that the breach was somewhat less massive than originally thought, affecting roughly 383 million records rather than the 500 million originally said to have been compromised.

However, this little bit of positive news is overshadowed by the increase in passport records; 5.25 million unencrypted passport records plus 20.3 million encrypted passport records were snatched, which will be a headache for both the affected individuals and the State Department.

One of the central lessons that arose as a result of this breach is the adherence to the spirit of GDPR, which "forced companies to consider the personal data they hold and ask customers for, whether this data was really needed and if so how to properly protect it".

# tl;dr:
> The total number of records in the 2018 Marriott International breach is lower than initially estimated, but the number of extra-sensitive records including passport data continues to rise.
